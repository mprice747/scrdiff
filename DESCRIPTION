Description: Perform inference on function stationary points (where f'(x) = 0) through the 
template-diffeomorphism framework introduced by Price et. al. Performs MCMC on 
model parameters and then applies transformation of diffeomorphism to output a
joint posterior of the locations of the stationary poits.
